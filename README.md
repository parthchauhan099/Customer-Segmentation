# Customer-Segmentation
In this project, I implemented customer segmentation by combining the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) method with K-Means clustering. Where each customer was assigned an RFM score, followed by K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer segments. The dataset, comprising three years of retail sales data, served as the foundation for this segmentation.

Customer Segmentation

Customer segmentation is a vital strategy for understanding clients better and addressing their diverse needs more effectively. One of the most effective methods for customer segmentation is RFM analysis. This technique allows businesses to design personalized offers to boost sales and improve customer retention.

RFM Analysis Overview:
    Recency: Number of days since the customer last purchase or order.
    Frequency: Counts the total number of purchases made by the customer
    Monetary Value: Reflects the total amount spent by the customer per order.

Assigning customers ratings from 1 to 4, where Recency 4 being the highest and 1 being lowest Frequency & Monetary 1 being the highest and 4 being lowest
Final RFM score is obtained by combining these individual scores into a single value, which is then used to classify customers into different RFM categories.
